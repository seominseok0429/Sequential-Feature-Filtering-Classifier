## Abstract

In this study, we propose Sequential Feature Filtering Classifier (FFC), a simple but effective classifier for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Using sequential LayerNorm and ReLU, FFC zeroes out low-activation units and preserves high-activation units. The sequential feature filtering process generates multiple features, which are transmitted to a shared classifier, yielding multiple outputs. FFC can be applied to any CNN with a classifier and it significantly improves the performance with negligible overhead.  In this study, the efficacy of FFC is validated extensively on various tasksâ€”ImageNet-1K classification, MS COCO detection, Cityscapes segmentation, and HMDB51 action recognition. Moreover, it is empirically established that FFC can further improve performances using additional techniques, including attention modules.

## Models

Note that our top performance was **76.97** as a result of multiple runs, but the average of the results of multiple runs was **76.84** on the paper.
